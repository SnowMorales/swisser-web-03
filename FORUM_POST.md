# 🚀 [Release] Swisser-Web-01 - Modern FiveM RP Server Website Template

## Transform Your Server's First Impression

Hey FiveM community! 👋

Ever wondered why some servers have waiting lists while others struggle to fill slots? **It starts with the first impression.** That's why we created **Swisser-Web-01** - a premium website template that turns curious visitors into dedicated players.

After months of working with various FiveM communities, we noticed a pattern: servers with professional websites consistently outperform those without. Players judge your server's quality before they even connect. Make that judgment work in your favor.
